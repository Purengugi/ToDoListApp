2. Add a Task
3. Mark Task as Complete
4. Delete a Task
5. Exit
```

### **1. View Tasks**
- Select option `1` to view all tasks. The tasks will be displayed in a numbered list with their completion status:
  - `[✔]` for completed tasks
  - `[ ]` for incomplete tasks

### **2. Add a Task**
- Select option `2` to add a new task.
- You will be prompted to enter a task description, and it will be added to the list as incomplete.

### **3. Mark Task as Complete**
- Select option `3` to mark a task as complete.
- You will be shown a list of tasks, and you can enter the task number to mark it as complete.

### **4. Delete a Task**
- Select option `4` to delete a task.
- You will be shown a list of tasks, and you can enter the task number to delete it.

### **5. Exit**

## **File Handling**
- The tasks are saved in a JSON file named `tasks.json` in the same directory as the script.
- Each time you add, complete, or delete a task, the changes are automatically saved to this file.
- When you restart the app, it will load tasks from the `tasks.json` file, so your progress is never lost.

## **Project Modules**

### **1. `task_manager.py`**
Handles all task-related operations:
- **`add_task(tasks)`**: Prompts the user to enter a new task and adds it to the list.
- **`view_tasks(tasks)`**: Displays all tasks with their status (complete or incomplete).
- **`complete_task(tasks)`**: Marks a selected task as complete.
- **`delete_task(tasks)`**: Deletes a selected task from the list.

### **2. `file_handler.py`**
Manages loading and saving tasks to a JSON file:
- **`load_tasks(filename)`**: Loads tasks from the JSON file. If the file doesn't exist, it returns an empty list.
- **`save_tasks(tasks, filename)`**: Saves the current tasks to the JSON file, ensuring task persistence.

### **3. `menu.py`**
